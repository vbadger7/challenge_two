# challenge_two

In this challenge I was required to develop a website using my CSS knowledge and HTML knowledge. I created the website with a section of an about me exception about work specifically my work, and a section on how to contact me.
The section about me, gave a brief description as to who I am.
The section of work, had links that I had modified with CSS that took you to certain portions of my work such as my HTML work, my CSS work, and my JavaScript work
The contact navigation button up on the right hand side once clicked would navigate you to the portion of the page where my contact information is located. Upon clicking on my email it will open a default email program with my email address pre-programmed in the "to" field of a brand new email.
