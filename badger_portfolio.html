            <img src="../challenge_2/assests/images/me.jpg" class="me"/> 
            <p>At the time of reading this, I am a 36 year old combat veteran with 19 years of service. Throughout my military career, I have had mulitple jobs and responsibilities. When I switch my job to communications,
                It was when I found my passion for the IT world. I have had years of expirice in system diagnostics, routers and switches configurations, client image installs with stig hardening, server side adminitstration, 
                virtual desktop deployments, help desk operations and supervision, radio satelitte communications, to mention a few. However I have never really worked in any computer coding capacity. I am currently enrolled
                in the coding bootcamp for UT Austin and its looking to be my next avenue in my IT career.
